# Data-Analysis-of-Security-Records

Project undertaken as part of my college senior computer science internship. Program analyzes a csv file from Kaggle (linked below) that shows records of cyber attacks over the last decade (2015-24). Project shows results through graphs. Each item of the analyzed data has a color that carries all the way through each graph it is a part of for easy following of specific data. Final 4 graphs use a polynomial regression machine learning algorithm to show patterns over time.
